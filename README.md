# PowerBI-StudentDashboard

📘 Project Overview

This is my first Power BI project, where I built an interactive dashboard by combining two datasets —
🧾 Student Course Details (text data)
📊 Student Personal Details (Excel data)
The goal of this project was to analyze student enrollment trends, revenue generation, and demographic insights in a visually engaging way.

⚙️ Data Preparation
I performed data cleaning, transformation, and merging in Power BI.
Key steps included:
Removing duplicates and missing values
Converting text-based data into structured tables
Establishing relationships between the two datasets
Creating new calculated columns for total amount and student grouping

📈 Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes several interactive visuals:
💰 Total Amount & Total Students overview
📊 Sum of Fees by Course (bar chart)
📅 Count of Courses by Month (column chart)
👥 Course Count by Age Group (donut chart)
🎯 Gauge Chart showing course completion count
All visuals can be filtered dynamically by Year, City, and Course to gain deeper insights.
